    '''
    Determines the colour of the link to be used based on where the user clicks
    After previously getting levels from the actual Flow game, I use that to create what 
    essentially builds a whole new level using this function:
    '''
    global line_colour
    pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
    mouse_x = pos[0]
    mouse_y = pos[1]
    
    '''' Checks to see whether the grid position determined by dividing the x coordinate of the mouse and y coordinate 
    of the mouse match with the box in which the circles should be
    If they are clicked then the line_colour variable becomes equal to the stated colour
    I got levels from the original Flow game and used the logic of this matrix:
    
    -------------------------------
    | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
    -------------------------------
    | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
    -------------------------------
    | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |
    -------------------------------
    | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |
    -------------------------------
    | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 |
    -------------------------------
    | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 |
    -------------------------------
    
    This would mean I would have circles at any one of these positions which I then enter as arguments'''
